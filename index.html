<h1>Welcome to My Portfolio</h1>
<p>This is my personal portfolio showcasing my work.</p>
<h1>About Me:</h1>
  <p> My name is Denari Gassion, a soon to be graduate from Saint Xavier Univeristy, and over the past four years I have focused my studies on Computer Science
        while developing an interest in film and media. While I'm not so proficient in coding, I have developed an understanding of audio and video editing due to my studies in film and media.</p>
  <p> My career goal is to use what I know when it comes to computer science and my understanding of media to create a platform where others can show off their own creativity and develop a voice for themselves as well as
   share my own thoughts and ideas.</p>
